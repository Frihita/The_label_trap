Prompt for AI generator / web-builder:

Create an interactive card deck titled “THE LABEL TRAP.”
Use the same design foundation as the previous decks:

Deep purple-black background (#0B0016)

Neon pink-cyan gradient borders

Orbitron/Rajdhani for headings, Poppins for body text

Two-sided 3D flip cards (Y-axis rotation, 600 ms)

Each card has a front (question) and back (answer + fact)

Include a subtle glowing “Label Padega India” banner at the bottom encouraging users to read labels before buying.

No emojis, icons, or illustrations—pure text + minimalist vector accents only.

Maintain consistent spacing and vertical scroll.

CARD 1

Front Question:
“How much spinach do you think is actually in a pack of ‘Spinach Noodles’?”

Back Answer:
“Less than 1.5 percent. Most of the color comes from synthetic or dehydrated extract, not real spinach.”

Micro Fact:
“Marketing uses the green label trick—tiny ingredient, big claim.”

CARD 2

Front Question:
“Do you think your favorite tomato ketchup is packed with real tomatoes?”

Back Answer:
“Barely. Many commercial ketchups use under 25 percent tomato paste plus sugar, starch, and preservatives.”

Micro Fact:
“That thick texture? It’s often corn syrup, not tomato pulp.”

CARD 3

Front Question:
“If real fruit juice needs double the fruit to make one glass, how are ‘100% Real Juices’ sold cheaper than fruit?”

Back Answer:
“They’re mostly reconstituted from fruit concentrate, sugar, and flavoring—not fresh fruit.”

Micro Fact:
“Concentrates travel cheap. Real fruit doesn’t.”

END-SECTION BANNER

Text Block:
Label Padega India — A Healthara Awareness Initiative
“Every label tells a story—most of it hidden. Decode ingredients, not marketing.”

Small glowing line underneath:
